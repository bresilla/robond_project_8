    "In this notebook, you'll get introduced to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), a framework for building and training neural networks. PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.\n",

    "Here I'll use PyTorch to build a simple feedfoward network to classify the MNIST images. That is, the network will receive a digit image as input and predict the digit in the image.\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/mlp_mnist.png\" width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a neural network with PyTorch, you use the `torch.nn` module. The network itself is a class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`. You define each of the operations separately, like `nn.Linear(784, 128)` for a fully connected linear layer with 784 inputs and 128 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class needs to include a `forward` method that implements the forward pass through the network. In this method, you pass some input tensor `x` through each of the operations you defined earlier. The `torch.nn` module also has functional equivalents for things like ReLUs in `torch.nn.functional`. This module is usually imported as `F`. Then to use a ReLU activation on some layer (which is just a tensor), you'd do `F.relu(x)`. Below are a few different commonly used activation functions.\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/activation.png\" width=700px>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for this network, I'll build it with three fully connected layers, then a softmax output for predicting classes. The softmax function is similar to the sigmoid in that it squashes inputs between 0 and 1, but it's also normalized so that all the values sum to one like a proper probability distribution."
